income = expenditures = production (abstract from foreign trade)
income = basic income + compensations + profits = expenditures = production
income = consumption + savings
basic income = consumption
profits = savings = investments
compensations = consumption + savings
profits = constant share of income
basic income = constant share of compensations (e.g. wages)
basic income = taxes
taxes = percent of compensations + percent of profits (they could be collected indirectly, i.e. via VAT)
production = consumption + savings (investment)
growth of production = growth of population + growth of productivity
Rawlsian criterion of inequality = basic income should be financed from Pigou taxes on compensation (tax on rent called ability) and on profits (to the extent that it is a rent on ownership). 
All taxes cover basic income plus public goods (security etc.). Additional question is social security (health, education, other types of dependence; no fund for unemployed, however).
Key point 1: More income (because of basic income) = more production
Key point 2: Pigue taxation (taxing income that is a kind of a rent, so it does not affect behaviour, i.e. incentive to work or save and invest).
